idea on a whim\nHas turned into something more\nToo shy to explain to the owners that my first lesson was just a one-time thing\nI've continued to go to classes each week\nAt the precious little strip off Santa Monica and Bundy\n\nAnd everything was going fine\nWe were starting with dips and loops\nAnd then something terrible happened\n\nDuring my fourth lesson in the sky\nMy instructor, younger than I, but as tough as you\nInstructed me to do a simple maneuver\nIt's not that I didn't do it\nBut I was slow to lean the sports cruiser into a right-hand upward turn\nScared, scared that I would lose control of the plane\n\nNot tactfully and not gently\nThe instructor shook his head, and without looking at me said\n\"You don't trust yourself\"\n\nI was horrified\nFeeling as though I'd somehow been found out\nLike he knew me\nHow weak I was\nOf course, he was only talking about my ability as a pilot in the sky\nBut I knew it was meant for me to hear those words\n\nFor me, they held a deeper meaning\nI didn't trust myself\n\nNot just 2500 feet above the coast of Malibu\nBut with anything\nAnd I didn't trust you\n\nI could've said something but I was quiet\nBecause pilots aren't like poets\nThey don't make metaphors between life and the sky\n\nIn the midst of this mid-life, meltdown, navigational exercise in self-examination\nI also decided to do something else I had always wanted to do\nTake sailing lessons in the vibrant bay of Marina del Rey\nI signed up for the class as \"Elizabeth Grant\"\nAnd nobody blinked an eye\n\nSo, why was I so sure that when I walked into the tiny shack on Valley Way, someone would say\n\"You're not a captain of a ship, or the master of the sky!\"\nNo, the fisherman didn't care, and so neither did I\n\nAnd for a brief moment, I felt more myself than ever before\n\nLetting the self proclaimed drunkard captain's lessons wash over me like the foamy tops of the sea\n\nMidway through my forehead burned\nAnd my hands raw from driving\nThe captain told me the most important thing I would need to know on the sea\n\n\"Never run the ship into irons\"\nThat's nautical terms for not sailing the boat directly into the wind\n\nIn order to do that though, you have to know where the wind is coming from\n\nAnd you might not have time to look up to the mast\nOr up further to the weathervane\nSo you have to feel where the wind is coming from\nOn your cheeks, and by the tips of the white waves from which direction they're rolling\n\nTo do this, he gave me an exercise\nHe told me to close my eyes, and asked me to feel on my neck which way the wind was blowing\nI already knew I was going to get it wrong\n\"The wind is coming from everywhere, I feel it all over\" I told him\n\"No\", he said, \"the wind is coming from the left. The portside\"\nI sat waiting for him to tell me \"You don't trust yourself\"\n\nBut he didn't, so I said it for him\n\"I don't trust myself\"\n\nHe laughed gentler than the pilot, but still not realising that my failure in the exercise was hitting me at a much deeper level\n\n\"It's not that you don't trust yourself\" he said. \"it's simply that you're not a captain. It isn't what you do\"\n\nThen he told me he wanted me to practise everyday so I would get better\n\n\"Which grocery store do you go to?\" he asked\n\"To the Ralphs in the Palisades\" I replied\n\n\"OK. When you're in the Ralphs in the Palisades\nI want you, as you're walking from your car to the store\nTo close your eyes, and feel which way the wind is blowing\nNow, I don't want you to look like a crazy person crouching in the middle of the parking lot\nBut everywhere you go\nI want you to try and find which way the wind is coming in from\nAnd then, determine if it's from the port or starboard side\nSo when you're back on the boat you have a better sense of it\"\n\nI thought his advice was adorable\nI could already picture myself in the parking lot\nSquinting my eyes with perfect housewives looking on\n\nI could picture myself growing a better sense of which way the wind was blowing\nAnd as I did, a tiny bit of deeper trust also began to grow within myself\nI thought of mentioning it\nBut I didn't\nBecause captain's aren't like poets\nThey don't make metaphors between the sea and the sky\n\nAnd as I thought that to myself\nI realized\nThat's why I write\n\nAll of this

Not a very popular one\nI once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet, but upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky that I wished on over and over again, sparkling and broken\nBut I didn't really mind because I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted, and then losing it to know what true freedom is\nWhen the people I used to know found out what I had been doing, how I'd been living, they asked me \"Why?\", but there's no use in talking to people who have home\nThey have no idea what it's like to seek safety in other people, for home to be wherever you lay your head\nI was always an unusual girl\nMy mother told me I had a chameleon soul, no moral compass pointing due north, no fixed personality; just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean\nAnd if I said I didn't plan for it to turn out this way I'd be lying\nBecause I was born to be the other woman\nWho belonged to no one, who belonged to everyone\nWho had nothing, who wanted everything, with a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that I couldn't even talk about it, and pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me\n\nI been out on that open road\nBut you can be my full-time daddy, white and gold\nSinging blues has been getting old\nBut you can be my full-time baby, hot or cold\n\nDon't break me down (Don't break me down)\nI been traveling too long (I been traveling too long)\nI been trying too hard (I been trying too hard)\nWith one pretty song (With one pretty song)\n\nI hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast\nI am alone at midnight\nBeen trying hard not to get into trouble, but I\nI've got a war in my mind\nSo, I just ride, just ride\nI just ride, I just ride\n\nDying young and playing hard\nThat's the way my father made his life and art\nDrink all day and we talk 'til dark\nThat's the way the road dogs do it, light 'til dark\n\nDon't leave me now (Don't leave me now)\nDon't say goodbye (Don't say goodbye)\nDon't turn around (Don't turn around)\nLeave me high and dry (Leave me high and dry)\n\nI hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast\nI am alone at midnight\nBeen trying hard not to get into trouble, but I\nI've got a war in my mind\nI just ride, just ride\nI just ride, I just ride\n\nI'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy\nI'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes\nIt's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby\nSo I just ride, I just ride\n\nI hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast\nI am alone at midnight\nBeen trying hard not to get into trouble, but I\nI've got a war in my mind\nI just ride, just ride\nI just ride, I just ride\n\n[Spoken ending:]\nEvery night I used to pray that I'd find my people, and finally I did on the open road\nWe had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired anymore, except to make our lives into a work of art\nLive fast.

girl\nAh\nI wish I was your girl\nI wish I was your girl\nI wish I was your girl\nAh\n\nCarry me off the stage\nHad too much to drink\nBeen on tour too long\nAnd I've had too much time to think\n\nCarry me to my bed\nLay me in a pillow town\nKiss me on my head\nAnd remind me of the way we will not know\n\nI wish I was your girl\nI wish I was your girl\nI wish I was your girl\nAh\nI wish I was your girl\nI wish I was your girl\nI wish I was your girl\nAh\n\nLate at night, baby you're my sign\nCall me late if you wanna get high\nLate at night, laying in Versailles\nYou and I get to know one another\n\nLate at night, baby you're my sign\nCall me late if you wanna get high\nLate at night, baby you and I\nCan get to know one another\n\nCause late at night, we have one life to kill\nOh you and I\nCan get to know the thrill\nCause baby you're my sign\nAnd I wanna get to know ya\n\nI wish I was your girl\nI wish I was your girl\nI wish I was your girl\nAh\nI wish I was your girl\nI wish I was your girl\nI wish I was your girl\nAh\n\n(Ah)\n(Ah)\n(Ah)\n"}
